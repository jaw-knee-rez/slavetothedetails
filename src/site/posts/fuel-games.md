# Hello Fuel Games
<br/>

My name is John Resman, and I'd like to apply for the Visual Design Lead. I've been designing interfaces and experiences for people for over 10 years, and believe my skills designing complex interfaces people depend on daily can help the Fuel Games team out.

I thrive working in fast-paced environments that challenge and reward. I believe communication is key to success, and a prototype is worth 1,000 meetings. I relish in team settings where we can explore creative solutions, and iterate quickly to make it the best.

Below you'll find my latest work. For the last 4 years, I've been working with F500 companies and excited about bringing that experience to the gaming industry. If you or the team have any specific questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to talking with the Fuel Games team soon, cheers!
