The personal thoughts and work on product design from John Kellyn Resman

This project scaffold includes:

- Eleventy with a skeleton site and some configs I use regularly
- A date format filter for Nunjucks
- Sass pipeline
- JS pipeline
- Serverless (FaaS) development pipeline with Netlify Functions for Lambda


## Local development

To build the site you need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - to run the build
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - to install and manage dependencies


### Getting started

# install dependencies
yarn

# start a local build server with hot reloading
yarn start
```
